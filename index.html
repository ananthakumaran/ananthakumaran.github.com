    <div class="post">
      I write software programs for <a href="resume.html">living</a>, some of them are <a href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran">open source</a>. I am currently employed by <a href="https://www.gojek.io/">Gojek</a>. I try to better understand the world around me primarily via <a href="books.html">reading</a> fiction, non-fiction, and technical books. I spend my free time on acquiring knowledge about things that interest me, which currently happens to be data <a href="visualization">visualizations</a> and distributed systems. Occasionally, I write blog posts when I have something to say or ramble something out of sheer boredom, the list can be found below.
