Section 80TTA of Income Tax Act allows deduction up to ₹10,000 on the
income earned as interest from a savings account. At <span
id='base'></span> interest rate for savings account, a principal of
₹<span id='principal'></span> would generate ₹10,000 as interest in a
year. The effective amount of interest you would make for the same
principal in fixed deposit scheme would differ based on the tax slab
(slab 1 - 10%, slab 2 - 20%, slab 3 - 30%) you belong to. You should
use fixed deposit scheme as long as the interest rate is higher than
<span id='slab_1'></span>, <span id='slab_2'></span>, <span
id='slab_3'></span> for slab 1, slab 2 and slab 3 respectively.
