As Every college in India did, our college taught us a bunch of
programming languages namely c, assembly language, c++, java, C#. I
never written much code other than lab excercise in any language
except java. I choose java because, i really got interested in
programming in the third year and that was the time, they taught
java. So i used to write all my crap in java.  As i got more and more
interested in programming, i started to read
[many](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/)
[blogs](http://www.codinghorror.com/) and i finally decided to learn a
[new language](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Know_Well_More_than_Two_Programming_Languages).
I spent some time evaluating the new language like Ruby, Python, etc
and finally decided to go with Scala.


I decided to
[learn](http://ananthakumaran.tumblr.com/post/445483380/programming-language-2010)
Scala because it looks similliar to java and it is concise.  It went
well for a few days. Then i had a feeling that i was missing something
very important. So i
[asked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573899/why-is-scala-very-complex)
some people and then found that i need to learn the basic functional
programming concepts like lambda, recursion, immutability, no side
effects, higher order function etc.  Scala is a Hybrid
language(functional and imperative).I was familiar with
OOPS(imperative), but never heard of functional programming.

I read the
[The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992?ie=UTF8&tag=anankumasblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262560992)
book. This Book was different from all the books out there ( at least
from the books i have read so far). It looked like a list of exercise
program. It was a small book and i was able to finish it in a couple
of weeks.

`To understand Recursion, you first need to understand Recursion`

Before reading this book, i was not very clear about the
recursion. Although i used recursion, i found it a bit difficult to
grok. After reading, my understanding about the recursion improved a
lot.  (Finally i am getting recursion :)).


In Functional Language, functions are first class citizens. We can
pass them to other functions. My first reaction was, " `oh my god, It
is great` ". Although i have written lot of javascript, I never
understood the real power of it until i read the book. In fact i was
amazed when i found that a function can return another
function([currying](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jeffm/Papers/curry.html)).


Instead of teaching the semantics of a language it teaches how to
solve a problem using programmatically. It uses Lisp to explain the
concepts. It won't teach you scheme language, but it will teach to how
to think recursively.


We can't read this book as reading a novel.  We have to sit and solve
all the problems by ourselves to understand the concept.  I highly
suggest you to read the
[The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992?ie=UTF8&tag=anankumasblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262560992
), if you are new to functional programming.  I may read the
[seasoned schemer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026256100X?ie=UTF8&tag=anankumasblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=026256100X)
in the future.
