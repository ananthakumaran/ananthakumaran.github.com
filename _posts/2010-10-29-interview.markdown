`written on 9th June 2010`

I think I will never publish this post. Who knows, my mind changes very
rapidly than I could imagine. But any how I will just write down my
interview experience here.

I think it was February 2010, Infosys came to our campus. They
selected around 150 students in our campus. They conducted two
rounds. A General Aptitude(I will use GA hereafter) round and a HR
round. Most of the people who cleared the first round cleared the HR
round as well. I couldn't clear the GA round. I was rather surprised
that they selected many non IT based students. Then TCS came after one
month, same thing happened for me, I failed in the GA round.

I guess there are several reasons why I failed, I was not in a great
form to solve puzzle. I was little nervous and didn't concentrate
well. But I guess the problems are not so simple. If you are seeing
that kind of problem for the first time then it will take some time to
solve. If you have already solved many problems of that kind, then you
can solve it quickly. I didn't want to spend my free time by reading
RS Agarwal or other puzzle books. So to wrap up, all the problem asked
in the GA was new to me. So it took lot of time for me to solve the
problem, but there was only thirty minutes. Any how both of the
company did a good job, they made me realize that I am not a genius.

There are some common things between this two company. I guess their
recruiting the based on the fact that, " if a student is smart, then
we can teach him something and make him write programs ".

One of my friend who got placed in infosys told me " you should have
got placed in infosys, they hired many people who had never done any
programming ". Infosys will give a three month or six month training
to the student and will put them to write code. Well many people still
fail during the training as well. If their recruiting method is good,
then no one should fail in the training.

I think no one will hire a juggler without seeing him juggling the
balls. But they are hiring people without seeing him writing code. As of
today, I have attended six or seven interviews and none of them asked
me to write a single line of code. This was rather a surprise for
me. I thought people will ask me write code for difficult
problems. But no one even bothered about that.

I forgot to write about today's interview. For your surprise I cleared
the first round, but failed in the second round. They told me that I
don't know to speak English. I guess this is my weak point. I am a
silent type. I don't speak very well. Maybe, this has to do something
with the way I grew.

I have been saying all the problems without saying any
solutions. There is no good solutions available. But I can sure of one
thing, if we write a program to print random register numbers, then it
will select good candidate than the current system.

They can conduct a technical interview instead of the GA round. Then
more people will write book about writing programs to solve
technical puzzle and students will read them instead of mugging the RS
Agarwal book.

I have been writing programs and reading technical book in all my free
time. So this interview procedure will not work for me. One way is to
get hired is, I have to put my butt in a chair and solve all the
problems in the puzzle book and I need to speak boldly.  Then there is
a chance to get hired in an interview. Well this is hard to do. I don't
want to spend my time by solving those puzzle. The other way is get a
job through a friend or any relatives. I like the second option
although it is not fair to do.

Update
------
Finally I got a job in [Artha42](http://www.artha42.com). Well they
asked me to write code :).

There is something that stops me from publishing this post. I'm afraid
that people will think that, I'm against the MNC because I failed in
their tests. Well that is somewhat true. I would not written this post
if I got placed in Infosys or TCS.
