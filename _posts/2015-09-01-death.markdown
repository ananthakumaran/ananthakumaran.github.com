title: Death
---

Human, the only species on the earth which is consciously aware of the
fact that death is inevitable. Although everyone is aware of the fact,
most of them act in such a way that they are going to live
forever. The human race as whole lives, reproduces and goes on. Though
it might make sense for the race as a whole — where it is marching
towards is out of scope of this discussion — it never makes sense for
an individual to take part in this.

It leads to the inevitable question, why does a human choose to live,
when he can easily kill himself. Thus liberating himself and the yet
to born descendants from the worldly misery. What makes human beings
resilient against suicidal thoughts. I am sure everyone — at least
those who have crossed their childhood — must have contemplated
suicide at some point in their life. But almost all of them try to
bury the thought deep inside their mind, afraid of it, even though
they know nothing about what lies ahead.

We wouldn't be here if all our ancestors had decided to kill
themselves. But this doesn't explain the fact nonetheless. What keeps
them going forward. What keeps them from exploring the other end of
the death.
