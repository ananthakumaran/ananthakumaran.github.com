Writing is a powerful medium, which when controlled by a skillful
writer could evoke a captivating world in the mind of the reader --
something the reader couldn't have come up by himself. Knut Hansum
takes it to the next level in the book Hunger. Instead of creating a
world which could be observed by the reader as an omnipresent God, he
chooses to place the reader inside the world as a character, make the
reader go through the same sensations of the protagonist in the story,
make him feel how it would be to be hungry and delirious.
