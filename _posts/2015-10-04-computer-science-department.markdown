title: Sad State of Computer Science Department
tags: industry

Except some high profile engineering colleges like IIT, the quality of
professors in most of the engineering colleges is pathetic. But this
reaches a whole new level in Computer Science department, where a
professor who has no idea about the fundamentals of compiler could
teach you the compiler course, by dictating whatever is written on the
course book, and dodge any questions raised by students by blabbering
something irrelevant to the question.

It begs the natural question: why the situation is so bad in CS
department compared to others?

The main problem seems to be the demand and supply of computer science
professionals â€” which determines the salary indirectly. The supply is
very less compared to the demand, even people with pathetic skill set
get a job as a software engineer with a good salary.

Most of the colleges pay peanuts compared to the software industry
salary. This may be good enough to attract competent professors in
other departments, where there is a huge supply of professionals
compared to the demand. But this is definitely not the case in the
software industry.

The result is, most of the people who show up for the professor job
interviews are the ones who don't even have the minimal skill set
required to get a job in software industry.
