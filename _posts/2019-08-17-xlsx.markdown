title: Generate XLSX with unlimited rows
---

In my previous post I have talked about Elixir
[stream](https://ananthakumaran.in/2017/11/28/stream.html). In this
post I am going to talk about a particular use case. How would one
approach the problem of generating a Excel spreadsheet with unlimited
number of rows. The main constrain is that we only have a limited memory available.

The first part of the problem is to understand the XLSX file format. I
won't get into the details here, but there is a nice
[article](http://officeopenxml.com/anatomyofOOXML-xlsx.php) about the
anatomy of the XLSX file. In essence, XLSX is just a zip file with
different file extension.

&#9474;&#160;&#160; &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; app.xml
&#9474;&#160;&#160; &#9492;&#9472;&#9472; core.xml
&#9492;&#9472;&#9472; <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">xl</span>
    &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">_rels</span>
    &#9474;&#160;&#160; &#9492;&#9472;&#9472; workbook.xml.rels
    &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; sharedStrings.xml
    &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; styles.xml
    &#9500;&#9472;&#9472; workbook.xml
    &#9492;&#9472;&#9472; <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">worksheets</span>
        &#9492;&#9472;&#9472; sheet1.xml
</pre>

Except `sheet1.xml`, other xml files are just made of static contents
that will be nearly the same size regardless of the number of rows.

Now we have two smaller problems

1) can we generate xml using stream.

2) can we combine multiple xml stream and generate a zip stream.

<div class="diagram"><img class="margin-right" style="right: -300px" src="/public/images/tree.svg" /></div>

Let's start with the xml problem. In abstract sense, xml document is a
tree structure. To print a xml document, we have to first print the
open tag `<tag>` and all its children and the close tag
`</tag>`. Let's say we do a pre-order like traversal, at any point in
time, we have to keep the list of parent nodes in a stack like data
structure. Essentially at minimum we would need memory proportional to
the depth of the tree. Fortunately, most of the xml documents we deal
in real world won't have much depth. In our case with spreadsheet, the
max depth would be less than 10.


Let's take the example of generating html table. Consider the case of
generating table with unlimited rows and unlimited cells within each
row.

```elixir
import XmlStream

rows = Stream.map(1..1000_000, fn row ->
  Stream.map(1..1000, fn cell ->
    {row, cell}
  end)
end)

element(
  "table",
  Stream.map(stream, fn row ->
    element(
      "tr",
      Stream.map(row, fn {row_index, cell_index} ->
        element("td", content("row #{row_index} cell #{cell_index}"))
      end)
    )
  end)
)
|> XmlStream.stream!
```

We have a nested stream called `rows` and a xml document constructed
based on that stream using primitives like `element` and
`content`. `element` takes tag name as the first argument. The second
argument represents the children, it could be a either a stream or a
text generated using `content`.

`XmlStream.stream!` is the one which does the real work. It takes a
xml document and returns a byte stream. Essentially what it does a
pre-order traversal of the xml doc and emits the required tags
whenever it enters a exists a node.

Even though the approach makes sense, we haven't explained how to do a
pre-order traversal using
[Stream](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html) module. There is no
Stream.traverse function, but it's quite trivial to implement a
traverse function on top of
[Stream.flat_map](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#flat_map/2)

```elixir
def traverse(stream, leaf?) do
  Stream.flat_map(stream, fn node ->
    if leaf?.(node) do
      [:leaf, node]
    else
      Stream.concat([
          [:node_start],
          traverse(node, leaf?),
          [:node_end]
      ])
    end
  end)
end

traverse(rows, &is_tuple/1)
|> Stream.each(&IO.inspect/1)
|> Stream.run
```

The important part is the recursive call. The callback function passed
to [Stream.flat_map](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#flat_map/2) can return either normal list or another stream. In
case of stream, it will be forced which will trigger another
Stream.flap_map and so on. At any point in time, we will have at max
only one active stream per level of depth. A full implementation of
XmlStream can be found at
[activesphere/xml_stream](https://github.com/activesphere/xml_stream). Even
though the code might look complicated, the essential principle is the
same.

Now that we have solved the first problem, how could we combine these
xml streams and generate a zip file.

If we look at the overview of the zip file format in the
[specification](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT),
we can find two important headers: local file header and central
directory header.

```
[local file header 1]
[encryption header 1]
[file data 1]
[data descriptor 1]
.
.
.
[local file header n]
[encryption header n]
[file data n]
[data descriptor n]
[archive decryption header]
[archive extra data record]
[central directory header 1]
.
.
.
[central directory header n]
[zip64 end of central directory record]
[zip64 end of central directory locator]
[end of central directory record]
```

Both local file header and central directory header contain fields
like crc-32 and compressed and uncompressed file size. Fortunately,
these fields are optional in the local file header. We could just set
these fields to 0 in the local header.

```elixir
Zstream.zip([
  Zstream.entry("xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml", sheet1_stream),
  Zstream.entry("xl/worksheets/workbook.xml", workbook)
])
|> Stream.into(File.stream!("spreadsheet.xlsx"))
|> Stream.run
```

Assume we expose an interface like the above, we could use a
combination of
[Stream.flat_map]((https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#flat_map/2))
and
[Stream.transform](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#transform/4).

```elixir
def zip(entries) do
  Stream.concat([
    [{:start}],
    Stream.flat_map(entries,
      fn %{stream: stream, name: name, options: options} ->
        Stream.concat(
          [{:head, %{name: name, options: options}}],
          stream
        )
      end),
    [{:end}]
  ])
  |> Stream.transform(fn -> %State{} end, &construct/2, &free_resource/1)
end
```

The entries are flat mapped and extra annotations are added, so we
know when a file stream starts and when it ends. The construct
function will then just emit correct zip headers and keep track of the
list of files and their size in the state.

```elixir
defp construct({:start}, state) do
defp construct({:end}, state) do
defp construct({:head, header}, state) do
defp construct(chunk, state) do
```

When all the streams are emitted and it hits the `:end` annotation,
the central directory headers will be emitted based on the data in the state.

The only time we need to use unbounded memory is for the state where
we keep track of the central directory headers. But as we use very
small amount of memory per file, this should not be an issue in real
world. The full source code of the library can be found at
